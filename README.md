# Quick Start

Install/update `pie`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/elliotchance/pie
```

## Built-in Types

`pie` ships with some slice types ready to go (pun intended). These include:

- `type [Strings](https://godoc.org/github.com/elliotchance/pie/pie#Strings) []string`
- `type [Float64s](https://godoc.org/github.com/elliotchance/pie/pie#Float64s) []float64`
- `type [Ints](https://godoc.org/github.com/elliotchance/pie/pie#Ints) []int`

These can be used without needing `go generate`. For example:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/elliotchance/pie/pie"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	name := pie.Strings{"Bob", "Sally", "John", "Jane"}.
        Without(func (name string) {
            return strings.HasPrefix(name, "J")
        }).
        Transform(strings.ToUpper).
        Last()

    fmt.Println(name) // "SALLY"
}
```

## Custom Types And Structs

Annotate the slice type in your source code:

```go
type Car struct {
    Name, Color string
}

//go:generate pie Cars
type Cars []Car
```

Run `go generate`. This will create a file called `cars_pie.go`. You should
commit this with the rest of your code. Run `go generate` any time you need to
add more types.

Now you can use the slices:

```go
cars := Cars{
    {"Bob", "blue"},
    {"Sally", "green"},
    {"John", "red"},
    {"Jane", "red"},
}

redCars := cars.Only(func(car Car) bool {
    return car.Color == "red"
})

// redCars = Cars{{"John", "red"}, {"Jane", "red"}}
```

Or, more complex operations can be chained:

```go
cars.Without(func (car Car) {
        return strings.HasPrefix(car.Name, "J")
    }).
    Transform(func (car Car) Car {
        car.Name = strings.ToUpper(car.Name)
        
        return car
    }).
    Last()

// Car{"SALLY", "green"}
```

# FAQ

## What are the requirements?

`pie` supports many Go versions, all the way back to Go 1.8.

## What are the goals of `pie`?

1. **Type safety.** I never want to hit runtime bugs because I could pass in the
wrong type, or perform an invalid type case out the other end.

2. **Performance.** The functions need to be as fast as native Go
implementations otherwise there's no point in this library existing.

3. **Nil-safe.** All of the functions will happily accept nil and treat them as
empty slices. Apart from less possible panics, it makes it easier to chain.

4. **Immutable.** Functions never modify inputs, unlike some built-ins such as
`sort.Strings`.

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely. Pull requests are always welcome. Your PR must include:

1. Unit tests.
2. Update the README to list the new functions.

## Why is the emoji a slice of pizza instead of a pie?

I wanted to pick a name for the project that was short and had an associated
emoji. I liked pie, but then I found out that the pie emoji is not fully
supported everywhere. I didn't want to change the name of the project to cake,
but pizza pie still made sense. I'm not sure if I will change it back to a pie
later.
