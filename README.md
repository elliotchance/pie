**Enjoy a slice of pie!** `pie` is a utility library for dealing with slices
that focuses only on type safety and performance:

```go
shortNames := pie.Strings{"Bob", "Sally", "John", "Jane"}.
	If(func(s string) bool {
		return len(s) <= 3
	})
```

There are also helper methods for common filters, like:

```go
namesNotStartingWithJ := pie.Strings{"Bob", "Sally", "John", "Jane"}.
	Unless(pie.HasPrefix("J"))
```

See the [go docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/elliotchance/pie) for full API.

# FAQ

## How do I use it?

You can include it like any other package through your favourite package
manager:

1. Go modules ([you should be using this one](http://elliot.land/post/migrating-projects-from-dep-to-go-modules)):
`go get -u github.com/elliotchance/pie`

2. Dep: `dep ensure -add github.com/elliotchance/pie`

## Why do we need another library for this?

Yes, there are some other great options like
[`thoas/go-funk`](https://github.com/thoas/go-funk),
[`leaanthony/slicer`](https://github.com/leaanthony/slicer),
[`viant/toolbox`](https://github.com/viant/toolbox) and
[`alxrm/ugo`](https://github.com/alxrm/ugo) to name a few.

A lot of my work is dealing with servers that need to be high performance. I
found myself creating all the same utility functions like StringSliceContains
because I wanted to avoid reflection.

## What are the goals of `pie`?

1. **Type safety.** I never want to hit runtime bugs because I could pass in the
wrong type, or perform an invalid type case out the other end.

2. **Performance.** The functions need to be as fast as native Go
implementations otherwise there's no point in this library existing.

3. **Nil-safe.** All of the functions will happily accept nil and treat them as
empty slices. Apart from less possible panics, it makes it easier to chain.

There are some downsides with this approach:

1. It won't support all slice types. Sorry, you can use these actions on
`[]Foo`.

2. Until
[parametric polymorphism (generics) possibly arrives in Go v2](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-generics-overview.md)
there will need to be duplicate code in `pie` to compensate.

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely. Pull requests are always welcome.
